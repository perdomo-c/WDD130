    <h2>Luis Alejandro Perdomo Cortazar</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, My name is Luis Perdomo,
        my full name sounds like it's from a soap opera haha.</p>
    <p>I'm 22 years old. I'm from Mexico City, Mexico.
        I live with my parents and my sister.</p>
    <p>I'm working to be an Elder, because of the pandemic I couldn't move forward, 
        but now I have the opportunity again.</p>
    <p>I love programming and this is my first time using HTML,
        I'm looking forward to learn everything about it.</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of Formula 1, I like the sport but my favorite
        part is how it brings my dad and me closer.</p>

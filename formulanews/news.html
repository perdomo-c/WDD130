                <h2 class="news-title">Perez looking to bounce back in France, as he insists he is 'still in contention'
                    for the championship.</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite his 57-point deficit to championship leader and teammate Max Verstappen, Sergio Perez is
                    still gunning
                    for overall glory in 2022.
                    But the Mexican driver admits he and his team can ill-afford any more DNFs, as he looks to hit back
                    in France.
                    Perez had at one stage been 15 points behind Verstappen, after winning the Monaco Grand Prix.
                    But since then, he has suffered from two retirements in four races including a DNF last time out in
                    Austria.
                    Looking ahead to the French GP, Perez said he's searching for a redeeming result.
                    "After a tough weekend in Austria, it's great to be back racing and have a chance to put things
                    right,” said Perez.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We have had two DNFs in the past three races and we can't afford that in the championships so I'm
                    aiming to
                    change that this weekend in France.
                    I'm still in contention for the drivers' championship, so personally it is also important not to
                    lose any more
                    points.”
                    "Last year I scored my second podium with the team in France, and I am very looking forward to
                    trying to repeat
                    that.
                    Paul Ricard is a challenging track because there are different racing lines you can take through the
                    corners and
                    it's not easy to know which is the best one to use.”
                    "The high temperatures will also be a factor to consider this weekend, physically it looks like it
                    will be a
                    very demanding race and we will have to see how it goes with the tire degradation because of the
                    heat."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teammate Verstappen won last year's French Grand Prix last year after passing title rival Lewis
                    Hamilton on the
                    penultimate lap of the race.
                    And the Dutch driver is looking forward to getting back to a track on which he and the team have
                    enjoyed success
                    before, as he set his sights on improving on the tire degradation issues that cost him victory in
                    Austria.
                    “We had a good result last year in France as a team,” said Verstappen. “The track has a lot of
                    technical and
                    high-speed corners towards the end, so it will be important to look after the tires,
                    especially considering it's going to be a very hot weekend. I'm looking forward to another race week
                    where we
                    can hopefully improve on our performance from Austria and learn from our result last time out.”
                    With Ferrari hoping to extend their streak to three consecutive wins and Mercedes pushing forward
                    with even more
                    upgrades in France, Red Bull face a stern test at Circuit Paul Ricard.

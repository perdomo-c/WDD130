    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Motorsports, particularly Formula 1, are often perceived as “too complicated, exclusive and expensive” this at
      times means that someone that showed interest in the world of racing “doesn't even bother”
      and misses out in this wonderful experience. What I want to do with my website is to create a place where everyone
      is welcome, where beginners and veterans can learn and share everything
      about the sport they love, I want to use reliable sources to explain as the simplest of terms as the most advanced
      technical upgrades. As well to keep race results up to date so you can have quick access to it.
      Sometimes this information is hard to find so the best thing I can do is to compile it all in a simple and
      intuitive website.
    </p> <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Like I said before the audience for this website is anyone who has shown interest in motorsports, beginners and
      veterans, it will be a place where you can find all interviews, additional content, official results, analysis,
      race schedules, things you didn't know and so on. Sometimes is hard to find this information because not all teams
      or drivers have the same reach or it's content that can only be found in their individual websites,
      I want to create a website that compiles all of this information in one place so casual fans or someone that
      didn't know that it was released have access to it.

    <h3>Races</h3>
    <p>
      Every year before a season begins, the teams are given an opportunity to test the cars they developed over the
      last winter,
      this is known as the pre-season testing. It consists of 3 days divided in 2 sessions each where they can run the
      new cars for 4 hours.
      Traditionally the pre-season testing is held in the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain.
      Additionally, this year there was a second
      test held in the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. The biggest story that came out of this years'
      tests was that Ferrari seemed
      comfortably ahead of its two biggest competitors: Red Bull and Mercedes, who engaged in a heated battle for the
      2021 championship title
      that apparently is the reason why both started on the back foot this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far this season there has been 11 races out of 22 in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first race of the season was the Bahrain Grand Prix.<br><br>
      It was held on the March 18-20 weekend. Here the pre-season testing predictions materialized, but not quite. It
      was true that Ferrari was the quickest,
      but Red Bull was following close behind, in fact they seemed extremely competitive throughout the race.<br>
      Ferrari's Charles Leclerc who started on pole position
      was challenged many times for the lead by reigning world champion Red Bull's Max Verstappen, unfortunately
      disaster would claim both Red Bull drivers with mere few laps to the finish line.<br>
      An issue with the fuel pumping system saw both cars retire, Verstappen had the chance to bring his car limping
      back to the pits, but his teammate Sergio Perez was not as lucky, his engine gave out
      making him lose control and spin while battling Mercedes' 7-time world champion Lewis Hamilton for the final
      podium place. This gave Ferrari its first 1-2 finish since Singapore 2019.<br>

      *Charles Leclerc scored an additional point for setting the fastest lap of the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second race of the season was the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.<br><br>
      It was held on the March 25-27 weekend. Sergio Perez claimed a first career pole in Saudi Arabia at his 215th
      attempt, the longest wait in F1 history.
      The Mexican took top spot from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with the pair split by just two-hundredths of a
      second.<br>
      The session had paused for an hour during Q2 after a violent high-speed crash for Haas' Mick Schumacher, who was
      transported to the medical center,
      where no injuries were revealed and later to hospital for precautionary checks.<br>
      Q1 saw Lewis Hamilton make a surprising exit in 16th, his first Q1 exit since Brazil 2017.<br>
      On race day Perez pulled away from Leclerc in the start and led for 16 laps, when Ferrari called Leclerc in for
      his pit stop Red Bull was pushed to cover
      it boxing their leading car, unfortunately as Perez was leaving the pits Williams' Nicholas Latifi crashed into
      the barriers triggering a safety car.
      This proved detrimental for the Mexican's race as he had to settle for a fourth position while Sainz, Verstappen
      and Leclerc capitalized from the SC.<br>
      Leclerc and Verstappen engaged in a thrilling battle for the lead that lasted until they saw the checkered flag,
      both demonstrating excellent car control
      and race craft as they were finding ways to get DRS from each other. Ultimately Verstappen and Red Bull's straight
      line speed advantage proved to be superior
      giving them the victory for only half a second, the closest race finish since Italy 2020.<br>
      (Note: The Safety Car (SC) and the Virtual Safety Car (VSC) are deployed when any hazardous object obstructs the
      track, all cars are required to lower their speed and maintain it bellow the pace that is being set by the Safety
      Car,
      this is better known as Delta Time. Those who don't adhere to this Delta can face disqualification from the
      session.)<br>
      (Note: The Drag Reduction System (DRS) is a mechanism located in the car's rear wing that opens it. This gives the
      vehicle a boost of aerodynamic efficiency or in other words top speed, this system was implemented to encourage
      overtakes
      and can only be used in the DRS zones and when the car behind is within one second of the car in front.
      DRS zones are specifically chosen for each track, normally they are placed on straights, since having DRS open
      while cornering can make the car unstable and lead to accidents.)

        Perez looking to bounce back in France, as he insists he is 'still in contention' for the championship<br><br>
        Despite his 57-point deficit to championship leader and teammate Max Verstappen, Sergio Perez is still gunning
        for overall glory in 2022.
        But the Mexican driver admits he and his team can ill-afford any more DNFs, as he looks to hit back in France.
        <br>
        Perez had at one stage been 15 points behind Verstappen, after winning the Monaco Grand Prix.
        But since then, he has suffered from two retirements in four races including a DNF last time out in Austria.
        Looking ahead to the French GP, Perez said he's searching for a redeeming result.<br>
        "After a tough weekend in Austria, it's great to be back racing and have a chance to put things right,” said
        Perez.
        “We have had two DNFs in the past three races and we can't afford that in the championships so I'm aiming to
        change that this weekend in France.
        I'm still in contention for the drivers' championship, so personally it is also important not to lose any more
        points.”<br>
        "Last year I scored my second podium with the team in France, and I am very looking forward to trying to repeat
        that.
        Paul Ricard is a challenging track because there are different racing lines you can take through the corners and
        it's not easy to know which is the best one to use.”<br>
        "The high temperatures will also be a factor to consider this weekend, physically it looks like it will be a
        very demanding race and we will have to see how it goes with the tire degradation because of the heat."<br>
        Teammate Verstappen won last year's French Grand Prix last year after passing title rival Lewis Hamilton on the
        penultimate lap of the race.
        And the Dutch driver is looking forward to getting back to a track on which he and the team have enjoyed success
        before, as he set his sights on improving on the tire degradation issues that cost him victory in Austria. <br>
        “We had a good result last year in France as a team,” said Verstappen. “The track has a lot of technical and
        high-speed corners towards the end, so it will be important to look after the tires,
        especially considering it's going to be a very hot weekend. I'm looking forward to another race week where we
        can hopefully improve on our performance from Austria and learn from our result last time out.”<br>
        With Ferrari hoping to extend their streak to three consecutive wins and Mercedes pushing forward with even more
        upgrades in France, Red Bull face a stern test at Circuit Paul Ricard. <br>
